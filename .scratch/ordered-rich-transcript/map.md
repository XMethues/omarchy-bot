# Ordered rich transcript

**Status:** resolved

## Authority

- [Feature specification](./spec.md)
- [Ordered transcript ADR](../../docs/adr/0007-preserve-ordered-agent-blocks.md)
- [Accepted workspace design](../../docs/workspace-redesign.md)
- [Agent adapter contract](../../docs/agents-integration.md)
- [Workspace language](../../docs/contexts/workspace/CONTEXT.md)
- [Agent Integration language](../../docs/contexts/agent-integration/CONTEXT.md)

The feature specification defines product behaviour. Context documents define canonical terms. The ADR records the durable cross-context boundary. Historical Activity tickets describe the implementation they delivered but do not override this effort.

## Frontier

All six ordered rich transcript tickets are complete.

## Cross-cutting invariants

- Response Blocks, Thinking Blocks, Tool Calls, Steering, and recognized product content preserve occurrence order.
- Hidden Tool Calls and Thinking remain received and retained; display settings never alter Agent behaviour.
- Only officially exposed reasoning or provider-authored summaries are Thinking.
- Full Tool Call input and output are not transcript history.
- Native Events are residual Agent-specific signals, not a generic Thread content type.
- Bot Activity remains independent from transcript content and means only active versus inactive.
- Only Pi is implemented in this effort; every other Agent remains Pending.
