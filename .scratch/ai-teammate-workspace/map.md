# AI teammate workspace

**Status:** completed

## Authority

- [Feature specification](./spec.md)
- [Accepted workspace design](../../docs/workspace-redesign.md)
- [Bot and Agent decision](../../docs/adr/0002-user-created-bots-reference-agents.md)
- [Workspace language](../../docs/contexts/workspace/CONTEXT.md)
- [Agent integration language](../../docs/contexts/agent-integration/CONTEXT.md)
- [Computer control language](../../docs/contexts/computer-control/CONTEXT.md)

The specification and accepted design define product behavior. Context documents define canonical terms. ADRs record durable trade-offs. Resolved tickets record the delivered slices and must not override those authorities.

## Cross-cutting invariants

- A Bot is a persistent user-created or conservatively preserved assistant. An Agent is a Pi, Claude, or Codex execution backend. Enabled Agent inventory is never a Bot.
- Migration retains user-owned conversation, profile, and configuration data, records `user_created`, `legacy_conversation`, or `legacy_inventory` provenance, deletes only proven inventory, and preserves ambiguity.
- Each Agent adapter returns the sole `AgentCapabilityInventory` used for steering, abort, session deletion, Thread actions, attachment modalities, and native event families.
- Avatar Recipes use the sole current renderer `dicebear-core@10.7.0+styles@10.6.0`; upgrades replace unsupported recipes with deterministic current defaults instead of shipping compatibility renderers.
- Create and History use desktop Dialogs and narrow BottomSheets. Computer uses a desktop drawer and narrow BottomSheet.
- Emergency control is absent while idle and immediately available while computer input is active or stopped.
- Browser E2E is role-first and treats accessible roles and visible names as the public user seam.
